Monkey uses very low CPU and Memory consumption, it works fine on any x86, x86_64 platform without problems.

Regarding to the software required to run Monkey successfully, you will need a Linux environment with Kernel version 2.6.29 (at least). The server is developed on top of the Kernel features, so use an older version can cause some buggy behaviors.

Besides the kernel version, the core of Monkey just requires two basic libraries: pthreads and libc, if you use Linux, we are 99% sure that you should not care about this requirement.
